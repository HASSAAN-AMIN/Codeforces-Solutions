# Codeforces Solutions 

This repository contains my accepted solutions for Codeforces problems

I upload my solutions here to:

- Track my competitive programming progress  
- Improve problem solving skills  
- Maintain a clean archive of solved problems  
- Share code with others for learning  
- (Tbh to know how github works 😭💀)

##  Structure

Each file is named by the problem number and letter:

Example:
